This is a tool for making the correct housing decisions that I made in afternoon.
It allows to estimate travel times and assign goodness scores (TBD) to different locations.

We could have done it manually, but I'll be damned if I gotta perform the same action twice. 

# How to use
See the [main.ipynb](main.ipynb) for how it works.

The info I need from you boys is, option and importance (linear scaling):
* Destinations
* Time (night or day)
* Mode of transportation (transit or bicycle/walking)
    * If you plan on having a car I can modify it to drive.

While developing this tool, I can easily see that it has a very obvious **USP** : 

**Effort free picking of optimal meeting locations, be it for business meeting, friend group, or event**

The underlying algorithms are either basic or exported to an API, the only thing missing is user interface as either a website or phone app.

Customer acquisition would mainly be on reference basis or for whole organisation.

The price should be minimal and sold as something that for a few bucks would allow you to save precious business hours. The only reason why most people struggle to agree for a place to meet is cuz they live at random places. This would be especially useful for large cities.
